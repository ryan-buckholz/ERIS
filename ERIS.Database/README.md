#Instructions for MySQL Workbench

Go to the webpage https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ to download and install MySQL Community Server 8.0.27 including MySQL Workbench. You can choose corresponding download files based on your operating system. The version for Red Hat Enterprise is recommended.
Once you installed MySQL Workbench, you can restore a schema including tables and indexes using a .sql file uploaded to ERIS/ERIS.Database folder. 

Method of schema restoration:
Click on the menu of Server -> Data import, choose 'import from Self-Contained file', choose the .sql file, and click on 'Start Import'. If you have same schema, please use a new schema name or replace the existed schema.

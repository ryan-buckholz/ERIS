# ERIS

Commmit Rules:
All work shall be done in their own "feature" branches
  -Feature branches will be created when starting a user story/card
  -Named as the card number
Nothing should be committed if it is not functional. (You have ran it in simulator)
Comments should be added to commits, Containing the card number followed by description of feature
  -If multiple people are working on the same card/branch, merge conflicts should be resolved between them, and if necessary put to a team vote.

Branch Structure:
Playing with the idea of branches for dev, then feature
  -main -> dev -> feature
  -then merged back in feature -> dev -> main
  
  main ->
           dev ->
                 feature
                 feature
                 feature
                 feature

# ERIS

Commmit Rules:
All work shall be done in their own "feature" branches
  Feature branches will be created when starting a user story/card
  Named as the card number
Nothing should be committed if it is not functional. (You have ran it in simulator)

Branch Structure:
Playing with the idea of branches for Test, dev, then feature
  main -> test -> dev -> feature
  then merged back in feature -> dev -> test -> main

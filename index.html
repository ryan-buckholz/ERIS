<h3>Background</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	David Jang works with CalTrans and is the sponsor of the ERIS project. His business operates and maintains the California State Highway System. They ensure the safety of travelers and goods on vehicles on the highways.<br>
	<br>
	The problem that the client needed to be solved is the slow process of sending and viewing a report of a highway incident. Engineers have to physically return to the office to send a report about an incident. This report is not done electronically.

</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	The scope of the ERIS project includes a database that contains the paper report's data, a web application that views the report data, and a mobile application that sends the report data to the database server. The main business problem will therefore be addressed.<br>
	<br>
	The ERIS Project's goal is solving the business problem by providing a robust and fast electronic system that replaces the paper report form. Another important goal of the ERIS project is creating detailed documentation that makes later iterations on the codebase easy for the current and future developers.
</p>

<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	The proposed solution to the business problem requires continuous communication with the client to ensure that the requirements of the project are successfully delivered. We designed and confirmed, with the client, the GUI using online GUI tools.<br>
	<br>
	We then arrived at a decision on the tech stack after discussion and following the IT standards from CalTrans. We will be using C# with the Xamarin API and ASP.NET core for the mobile application and its WebAPI. We will be using React for the Web Application. We will be using MySQL for the report database.<br>
	<br>
	We will be working with the CalTrans IT so we can test and deploy the software on their servers. If there are any complications on getting access to the CalTrans servers, we will use identical OS and other required software for testing in our environments.<br>
